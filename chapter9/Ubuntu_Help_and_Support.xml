    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Help and support for Ubuntu is readily available through a number of
    sources so you need not panic if you run into a problem. Essentially there
    are two channels for accessing support:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">The first level is: </emphasis> Free,
        community based and involves system and online documentation, mailing
        lists, forums, IRC channels and Launchpad.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">The second level is: </emphasis> Paid
        for, commercial services through Canonical itself and / or various
        partners.</para>

    <title>System Documentation</title>

    <para>The first resource that you should explore is the offline system
    documentation. The <ulink url="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam">Ubuntu Documentation
    Team</ulink> maintains and updates the documentation for each release.
    This documentation is very reliable and available in different
    languages.</para>

    <para>Ubuntu System documentation is organised into topic based help,
    including answers to common questions. It is accessed by clicking the
    <emphasis role="strong">Help and Support</emphasis> button located under
    the System Menu. The following screenshot shows the home page of the Help
    and Support offline system documentation.</para>

    <para>New to Ubuntu? This section introduces you to the wonderful world of
    Ubuntu including an easy to use guide if you are migrating from Microsoft
    Windows to Ubuntu. Also in this section, the help guide will explain how
    to use your desktop, the role of the administrator and basic computer
    skills. A great resource for any newcomers and a top-up to this desktop
    course.</para>

    <para>Some applications do also offer access to the help system through
    the <emphasis>Help</emphasis> menu or keyboard shortcut
    <emphasis>F1</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>One of the great features of the system documentation is the ability
    to search the documentation to help solve the problem you have. Simply
    type in the term you are looking for and the system will search all the
    documents and guides with related information.</para>

      Web.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The online Ubuntu documentation is available at <ulink url="https://help.ubuntu.com"> https://help.ubuntu.com</ulink>. There are
    two different types of documentation available on this site, official and
    community.</para>

    <para>The official documentation is the documentation that is included
    with your Ubuntu installation by default and is locally accessible from
    your Ubuntu desktop. You can also access this documentation on the
    Internet at the Web site mentioned above.</para>

    <para>The following screenshot shows the home page of the Ubuntu
    documentation site:</para>

    <figure float="0">
      <title>Online Documentation</title>

      <mediaobject>

          <imagedata fileref="images/Lesson10_images_003.jpg" width="17cm" format="JPG"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The documentation is classified according to the various Ubuntu
    releases, such as Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 7.10 and 6.06 LTS.</para>

    <para>To access the official documentation locally from your Ubuntu
    desktop, without connecting to the Internet, on the 
    <emphasis role="strong">System</emphasis> menu, click <emphasis role="strong">Help
    and Support</emphasis>. You can also use the Help icon on the top panel of the desktop.</para>

    <para>The information available in the official documentation will be
    enough to guide you through most topics and problems. However, if you are unable to
    find an answer to your queries here, you can look for answers in the
    second type of documentation available on this site. This is documentation
    created by the community, without following the stringent quality control
    process of the Ubuntu Documentation Team. Access this documentation via
    the tab labelled <emphasis role="strong">Community Docs</emphasis>. The
    community documentation is stored on a Wiki, which allows the
    documentation to be changed quickly. While the community documentation
    covers more topics and some subjects in greater depth than the
    official documentation, the lack of quality assurance control and
    especially maintenance makes it a slightly less reliably
    alternative.</para>

    <para>The community documentation is a large collection of
    community-contributed documents, primarily covering the following
    topics:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Migrating from other operating systems, such as Microsoft
        Windows and Red Hat</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Post-installation configuration for a variety of tasks such
        as</para>

        <itemizedlist>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

    community documentation:</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The community documentation is also classified under various
    categories. You can select the desired category from the page index at the
    right of the page. You can also use the <emphasis role="strong">Search</emphasis> field in the top-right corner of the page
    to look for specific information within the community documentation. Be
    aware that <emphasis role="strong">Titles</emphasis> will restrict the
    search of your term to the pages titles only. If a search via titles does
    not produce any results, a full <emphasis role="strong">Text</emphasis>
    search may find the right page.</para>

    <para>You can also find relevant information on the <emphasis role="strong">CommonQuestions</emphasis> page. Access the <emphasis role="strong">CommonQuestions</emphasis> page by clicking the <emphasis role="strong">Common Questions</emphasis> link on the community
    documentation page.</para>

    <para>The following screenshot displays the <emphasis role="strong">CommonQuestions</emphasis> page on the Ubuntu Web
    site:</para>

    </figure>

    <para>Additional help is available to you in the form of Ubuntu
    screencasts. You can click the <emphasis role="strong">Ubuntu
    Screencasts</emphasis> link on the <emphasis role="strong">Community
    Documentation</emphasis> page to access a number of videos on using and
    installing Ubuntu. Each video is created with the aim of educating new
    users of Ubuntu. Each video is available in three sizes, large, medium and
    small, and two formats, OGG and Flash.</para>

    <para>The following is an example of a screenshot from a video on
    installing applications:</para>

    <title>Community Support</title>

    <para>The vast and ever growing Ubuntu community also offers a range of
    free support options for your Ubuntu desktop. Apart from the community

      <para>To get help on a specific problem, all you need to do is to send
      your query through e-mail to the relevant mailing list and you will get
      a quick response from the team.</para>

      <para>You will need to subscribe to the mailing list first by visiting
      the Ubuntu Mailing Lists Web site at <ulink url="https://lists.ubuntu.com/">https://lists.ubuntu.com/</ulink>. The

      <para>To get help for your Ubuntu desktop, you should go to the
      <emphasis role="strong">Community Support</emphasis> and select the
      <emphasis role="strong">ubuntu-users</emphasis> mailing list. This will
      take you to a page like the following:</para>

      <para>When you subscribe to a mailing list, a confirmation mail is sent
      to your provided e-mail to verify that it is your address. To activate

      <para>Soon after, you will receive a welcome mail containing the mailing

      e-mail messages to this list. Before sending your first query, it is
      good practice to read a bit of the archive, as the topic may have
      already been covered. The archive will also give you an idea of how much
      volume to expect from a list and get a "feel" of others who are active
      on the list.</para>

      <para>It is possible that you will be flooded with many responses to
      your posting. The level of emails received can be controlled by
      adjusting your preferences on the <emphasis role="strong">UserCP (User
      Control Panel)</emphasis>. You can use this panel to customize your
      profile and preferences too.</para>
