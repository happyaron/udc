The partition is the first level of foundation on the disk. Once the disk is logically carved up into partitions, it can be thought of as a house with rooms. Each partition (room) is of a specific size which could potentially be resized again after you move it, but would cause some disruption as objects get moved to make room. Once a partition (room) is created it can then be formatted using the filesystem of your choice. Once the filesystem has been laid down, it's possible to start populating the partition with data in the form of files and folders (furniture)."
