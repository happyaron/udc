    <title>About Open Source</title>
    <note userlevel="instructor">
      <title>Instructor Notes:</title>
      <para>The focus of this topic is to help students understand
      the concept of open source, which is the underlying
      foundation of Ubuntu. Briefly explain the dictionary meaning
      of 'open source' in general and move on to establishing how
      the open source ideology developed in the context of Linux.
      Present this as a story spread over different phases: Free
      Software Movement, Open Source Movement initiation and its
      formal launch. Explain the Ubuntu release schedule, naming
      convention and Ubuntu promise in detail.</para>
    </note>
    <para>Ubuntu is a Linux-based open source operating system. The
    term 'open source' can be defined as a set of principles and
    practices that promotes access to the design and production of
    goods and knowledge. Open source is generally applied to the
    source code of software and is available to users with relaxed
    or no intellectual property restrictions. This enables users to
    distribute, create and modify software content, either
    individually to meet their specific requirement or
    collaboratively to improve the software. Both open source and
    Linux have transitioned through various phases to reach their
    present form.</para>
    <para>The idea behind openly distributed source code is to
    encourage the voluntary, collaborative development of software.
    Users continuously enhance the software, fix bugs, develop new
    features and share it with others.</para>
    <para>As a result of collaborative software development which
    involves a large number of programmers, users receive software
    that is often better in quality and performance than
    proprietary alternatives. Users are encouraged to customise the
    software to their own personal requirements, which in itself is
    a huge step away from the 'one size fits all'
    philosophy.</para>
    <para>Open source projects call on the talents of many people
    with skills other than programming. Many projects involve
    artists, musicians, user-interface designers and documentation
    authors to create a complete product.</para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Free Software Movement, Open Source and Linux</title>
    <para>There is often confusion between open source, free
    software and Linux. While all three are inter-linked, there are
    distinct differences which are made clearer when looking at
    their evolution.</para>
    <sect2>
      <title>The Free Software Movement</title>
      <para>In the 1960s, it was typical for software to be
      distributed freely by companies such as IBM and shared
      amongst users. Software was then considered an enabler for
      the hardware, around which the business model of these
      corporations was built. Software was provided with source
      code that could be improved and modified; this was therefore
      the very early seeds of open source software. However, as
      hardware became cheaper and profit margins eroded in the
      1970s, manufacturers looked to software to provide additional
      revenue streams.</para>
      <para>In September 1983, Richard Matthew Stallman, former
      programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab launched
      the GNU project to create a free UNIX-like operating system
      (OS). He was concerned with growth in proprietary software
      and users' inability to access and modify programmes on their
      computers. Developer constraint, as opposed to freedom was
      prevalent. With the launch of the GNU project, Stallman
      started the Free Software Movement and in October 1985, set
      up the Free Software Foundation.</para>
      <para>Stallman pioneered the definition and characteristics
      of open source software and the concept of copyleft. He is
      the main author of several copyleft licenses, including the
      GNU General Public License (GPL), which is the most widely
      used free software license.</para>

      <para>By 1991, a number of GNU tools, including the powerful
      GNU compiler collection (GCC), had been created. However, a
      free kernel was not yet available to build a free OS that
      would use these tools.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>The Open Source Movement and Linux</title>
      <para>The difference between free software and open source
      can be defined as the difference between a social movement
      (free software) and a development methodology (open source).
      Linux refers to the kernel, or the backbones of the open
      source architecture.</para>
      <para>In August 1991, Linus Benedict Torvalds, a Finnish
      second-year student of computer science at the University of
      Helsinki, started working on Minix.</para>

        that Prof. Andrew S. Tanenbaum created with the intention
        to teach his students the internal processes of an
        OS.</para>
      </tip>
      <para>Linux was initially designed to be a Minix-like
      operating system that Linus Torvalds could use on his home
      computer. By mid-September, Torvalds released the first Linux
      kernel version 0.01. In 1994, Linux kernel version 1.0 was
      released under the GNU GPL. The free kernel and GNU tools
      provided a fertile environment for enthusiasts. By staying
      close to its UNIX roots, Linux provided a Command Line
      Interface (CLI) first; the adaptation of the X Window System
      made a graphical user interface (GUI) available at a later
      stage.</para>

        <para>Linux is not owned by any individual or company, not

        owns the trademark, Linux.</para>

      <para>Initially, Linux was a very technical, hard core open
      source programming tool. Thousands of developers contributed
      to its evolution as it became more user friendly. This has
      resulted in the launch of hundreds of commercial and
      non-commercial distribution versions, designed for everyday
      application use which are now available.</para>
      <para>In 1998, Jon "maddog" Hall, Larry Augustin, Eric S.
      Raymond, Bruce Perens et al formally launched the Open Source
      Movement. They promoted open source software exclusively on
      the basis of technical excellence.</para>

      <para>The open source movement and the dot.com boom of the
      late 1990s coincided, resulting in the popularity of Linux
      and the evolution of many open source friendly companies such
      as Corel (Corel Linux), Sun Microsystems (OpenOffice.org) and
      IBM (OpenAFS). In the early 21st century when the dot.com
      crash was at its peak, open source was in a prime position as
      a viable alternative to expensive proprietary software. Its
      momentum has strengthened since with the availability of many
      easy to use applications.</para>
      <para>As such, what started off as an idea became a passion
      to revolutionise a patent and license intense industry. With
      a significantly cheaper return on investment and enhanced
      usability features, Linux is now rooted as a viable option
      for enterprises and home users.</para>

      company specialising in digital certificates and
      cryptography. He sold Thawte to the U.S. company VeriSign in
      1999 and founded HBD Venture Capital and the Shuttleworth
      Foundation. He moved to London in 2001 and began preparing
      for the First African in Space mission, training in Star
      City, Russia and Khazakstan. In April 2002, he became a space
      traveller as a member of the cosmonaut crew of Soyuz Mission
      TM34 to the International Space Station. In early 2004, he
      founded the Ubuntu project, which aims to produce a free,

					to deploy Ubuntu and show desktop users (such as yourselves)
					how to use and get the most out of it. For more information

                                <para>A software repository is a library of software from where you can download
                                and install packages (applications) over the Internet. The Ubuntu software
                                repository contains thousands of packages that are freely available for
                                installation over the Internet. It is easy to install these packages because
                                they are specially built for Ubuntu. Ubuntu repositories are categorised into
                                four groups based on the level of support provided for their content /
                                applications and their source code components. These will be covered in more detail in lessons 3, 6 and 7.</para>

                                <para>The main component contains software packages that are free

                                with the free software philosophy. The packages in the main
                                component are available by default while installing Ubuntu. For all
                                packages in the main component, security updates and technical
                                support are available free of cost. OpenOffice.org, Abiword and the 
                                Apache web server are some of the packages found in the main
                                component.</para>

                                under a completely free license. Binary drivers produced by some
                                video card vendors are example of packages in the restricted
                                component. Packages in this component are also available on the

                                do not come with any support or security updates. Examples of these

      party applications and not just a Microsoft decision. With
      Ubuntu new release versions and applications are free.</para>

      <title>New version releases:</title>
      <para>There is only one released version of Ubuntu and
      therefore features available to home and professional users
      are the same. The Home and Professional editions of Microsoft
      Windows are not the same. For example, Microsoft Windows
      Professional editions have more security features than Home
      editions.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <para>Ubuntu's 6 monthly release cycle also makes it very easy
    for users to have access to all the latest applications. An
    upgrade from one release to the next is free and fully

				supported. Microsoft scheduled releases are less frequent and
    less visible to the public.</para>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Security aspects:</title>
			<para>Ubuntu is
				rarely targeted by malware and viruses. The administrative user
				root is locked by default in Ubuntu and only certain tasks are
				run with administrative privileges. Microsoft Windows provides
				an environment where people can access administrative user
    directly.</para>

      <title>Customisation:</title>
			<para>As you will
				discover throughout this course, Ubuntu is yours to design and
				personalise. You can have different flavours of Ubuntu running
				parallel; for example, you can install the Kubuntu (KDE)
				desktop together with Ubuntu (GNOME) and then select the
				desktop environment you want to use. More than 17,000 packages
				are available and easily accessible through the Internet. As a
				result, you are not stuck with using one version because it was
    the first you installed.</para>
    </formalpara>


    <para>Microsoft Windows is a standard OS with some options for
    customization. While many applications are available, most are
    proprietary software which incur a license fee.</para>

      <title>Data Storage:</title>
      <para>User data is often located in multiple locations in
      Microsoft Windows, which can make backing up and migrating
      from one computer to another tricky. Ubuntu saves your user
      information in one place - the home directory. This makes the
      migration of data from an old computer to a new one easy, as
      well as keeping user specific backup data separate.</para>

						<para>Both
							Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu come as pre-installed OSs on

          also useful for system recovery.</para>
          <para>The installation of Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu is

            The Add/Remove Applications allows you to search the

            Ubuntu and install the ones you want. In Microsoft
            Windows, each programme supplies its own installation

      Express, with a stripped down calendar or appointment
      application, Microsoft Windows Calendar. An upgrade to
      Outlook is suggested if you use the calendar often or if you

        <title>Multimedia:</title>
        <para>Several multimedia programmes are configured by
        default on Ubuntu, such as Audio CD Extractor, Brasero Disc Burning, Rhythmbox Music Player, Movie Player and Sound Recorder. Rhythmbox is the default application for playing audio CDs and organising music and playlists. Rhythmbox is similiar to Microsoft Windows Media Player. You can use Brasero to author audio CDs.

      <para>To play the mp3 format on Ubuntu, you need to install a
      codec pack. This is because Ubuntu is not distributed with
      mp3 codecs due to licensing restrictions. Playback of mp3
      files is enabled by default on some versions of Microsoft
      Windows.</para>
      <para>Vista has two multimedia programmes, Windows Media
      Player 11 (WMP for short) and Windows Media Center (WMC for
      short). WMP is best for playing music, and WMC is useful if
      you are using the computer as your core entertainment system.
      WMP can contain a large music library. With the index search
      system of WMP, you can search music numbers by a particular
      artist or search for specific numbers.</para>

				<para>With the Picture Gallery application of
					Microsoft Vista, you can upload thousands of images and add
					tags. You can also organise the images quickly and work on
					them easily because you can tag them with one click. F-Spot
					photo manager organises your personal photos on Ubuntu. It
					integrates seamlessly with popular Web based image databases,
      such as Flickr and Picasa Web.</para>
